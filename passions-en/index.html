				<h2>Motorsport</h2>
				<p>From the age of 7, my parents caught me watching F1. I don't know exactly where it came from, but, for example, my favorite cartoon is Cars. As I got older, I discovered Need For Speed Most Wanted on Xbox and, of course, Fast and Furious. If you ask a car fan where their passion came from, it's usually one of the three: Cars, NFS Most Wanted, or Fast and Furious. My parents have always been fascinated and amazed by my particular attraction to cars. Sometimes, on the freeway, my dad would pick up a car at random, and I'd be able to name the brand, model, and sometimes even the year it was built. I've always been the kid chasing a Ferrari, and the beauty of it is that I'm still that kid. Today, I'm still pursuing my passion, and my dream would obviously be to work in motorsport. I still watch F1, rally, the Dakar, and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. I play on simulators on all types of terrain whenever I have free time because at this stage, it's no longer passion; it's an obsession.</p>

				<h2>Seas <span>& Oceans</span></h2>
				<p>I've always been connected to the seas and oceans; I learned to swim even before I learned to walk, and I've always had this connection with water. It must have started when I was very young, as I often went to the seaside with my parents (the main advantage of being born in Marseille). My first sport was sailing, and you'll see below what I have to say about why I loved this sport. Today, my friends call me Aquaman every time we go to the sea because, even if it's 5°C, I'd still go in. Going to the sea is still one of my favorite activities, and I can't see myself living far from it; I know I'd miss it a lot. In and of itself, I'm not passionate about seas and oceans; the seas are an integral part of who I am.</p>

				<h2>Music</h2>
				<p>I've been immersed in music since I was a toddler. It was hours of singing, screaming in the car, and all over the house since I was a kid. Today I continue to listen to an enormous amount of music; my playlist grows by at least 10 songs each week with very different styles. I go from rock to electro, to rap, to classical... because I love music in its entirety. I'd like people to see it the same way I do; you don't need to like a genre to enjoy a song. Some say they don't like a certain kind of music, but it is impossible nowadays because so many artists mix genres, and personally, that's what makes me tick. As soon as I can, I go to festivals, concerts, really anything to do with music. Last year I was in my high school choir, and in two weeks, I have to do a performance on stage where others will dance, act a play, or tell a poem. Me, I decided to sing.</p>

				<h4> <span> 2010 – 2019 : </span> Sailing - Level 3 </h4>
				<p>Go and see the "seas and oceans" part of my passions, but I'd also add that if I continued this sport, it was also because it was one of the rare places where I felt at home. I was alone on my boat, the only place where I could have a moment's peace, where I could collect myself and find myself. Today, I still love going off on my own and settling down in the middle of the water, on the edge of a cliff, or in the middle of the forest just to enjoy that sweet moment of solitude with nature.</p>
				<p>This sport also made me appreciate my first victories. I did two years of regional competitions, specializing in strong winds. While boats were turning over one by one, a torpedo was going by, and that was me. In regattas with winds of over 70 km/h, I finished once in 2nd place and once in 3rd place, which enabled me to finish 3rd in the regional rankings at the end of the year and take home three magnificent trophies.</p>

				<h4> <span> 2019 – 2020 : </span> Danse Hip Hop  </h4>
				<p>It's worth noting that I grew up extremely fast and at a very young age. The consequences were that I didn't know how to master those big stilts, and I often found myself falling. So when I lost my taste for water sports, we decided to turn to dance, and a studio near my home offered hip-hop classes. This sport taught me to better control my body. I'm far from being good at dancing, but it had the positive point of teaching me to use this great body I've been given.</p>

				<h4> <span> 2021 – 2023 : </span> Climbing </h4>
				<p>Hip-hop was clearly not a sport I was 100% into; I needed to change. When I entered high school, my group of friends from college merged with a group of new ones I'm still friends with today. There was this girl I was madly in love with, and she was into rock climbing, so I decided to join her. I fell in love with the sport, so I did it for 2 years. I stopped this year because I was afraid I wouldn't be able to continue due to studies.</p>

				<h4> <span> 2020 – à ce jour :</span> Crossfit, Gym, Bicycle  </h4>
				<p>The COVID-19 pandemic meant we were all locked in at home. I was unable to do any sports, so I decided to exercise at home without any equipment. It was challenging, but I kept at it every day, and after a few months, the results were clearly there. So much so that my father decided to join me in my quest to become better, and today I continue to train because every day I have to be better than the man I was yesterday. It's as if every morning I'm fighting with him - if I win, I keep going; if I lose, I redouble my efforts. As simple as that, I added to it reading, lots of reading. While my father took up sports again thanks to me, it was he who introduced me to reading motivating, inspiring, and instructive texts: "The Path of the Archer," "The Guide of the Enlightened Knight," "The 48 Laws of Power," "The Toltec Agreements"...</p>

				<h4> <span> SUAPS : </span> Soccer, Gym, Karate  </h4>
				<p>My thirst for sport and discovery didn't stop there. For the next 3 years, I am allowed to take 2 sports per semester, offering me the opportunity to explore 12 different sports for free. I tried soccer and bodybuilding, but they weren't quite my fit. That's okay; it was an experiment. Now, I'm trying karate.</p>
